How do I add an origin for "webhook notifications from API" 
   I think I need this for javascript origins

What exactly are APIkeys and client ID's?

What are "underlying recurring events?"



Things to test - rooms that are reserved weekly, or by appointments. 

Things to think about -
       When calling the function that fills in conflicts, I will want to have a default date, but one
         that can be overridden if the users chooses a specific starting date for the grid





What do I want to do today?
     Options 
     	     - make a drop down tab that allows you to choose room
     	     - display some kind of grid.
	     - mess around with table layout a bit
	     -
